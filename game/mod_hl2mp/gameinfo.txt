		// Mapbase has a fairly unique file system that needs some explanation.
		// In its rawest form, it is spread out across 2-3 folders:
		// 
		// mapbase_shared - Shared Mapbase content, like editor icons, that are not unique to Half-Life 2.
		// mapbase_hl2 - Original HL2 branch of Mapbase.
		// mapbase_episodic - Episodic branch of Mapbase.
		// 
		// Each folder relies on the previous, meaning mapbase_episodic cannot function without mapbase_hl2 and
		// mapbase_hl2 cannot function without mapbase_shared.
		// 
		// mapbase_episodic > mapbase_hl2 > mapbase_shared
		// 
		// Each Mapbase folder has its own "content" subfolder containing VPKs.
		// These are mounted similar to the "custom" folder in which everything is mounted without listing out their names.
		//

			// First, mount all user customizations.  This will search for VPKs and subfolders
			// and mount them in alphabetical order.  The easiest way to distribute a mod is to
			// pack up the custom content into a VPK.  To "install" a mod, just drop it in this
			// folder.
			//
			// Note that this folder is scanned only when the game is booted.

			// system call.)
